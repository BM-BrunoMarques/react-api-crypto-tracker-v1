# Crypto Currency tracker - React


### Author: Bruno Marques
<br />


This App is an UI that fetches all the existing crypto currency coins from **Coin Gecko Api** and displays the data on a **100% responsive infinite scroll table** with the rows being **lazy loaded** to improve the performance of the application as well as the User Experience.


## Techonologies
This project was all built in **React**, mainly with **Hooks** and **functional components**. for this project I choose to use **useContext** hook to manage the state hierarchically. and used **Ant Design UI framework **

**DEMO**: https://crypto-brunom.netlify.app/
